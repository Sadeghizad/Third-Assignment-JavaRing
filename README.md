# Third Assignment: Java-Ring 🎮  
A turn-based RPG inspired by Souls-like games which can be run in terminal

### **Introduction**  
Welcome to **Java-Ring**, a turn-based RPG inspired by Souls-like games! In this assignment, you will develop a **text-based role-playing game (RPG)** that follows a structured combat system where players engage in battles against powerful monsters. This project is designed to reinforce your understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, including *inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces*.  

Your task is to implement a class hierarchy for different game entities, including **players and monsters**, each with unique abilities and attributes. By the end of this project, you will have a *functional game system* where players can **fight monsters in a turn-based combat system**, reinforcing your understanding of *OOP design* in a practical way.

### **What is a Turn-Based Game?**  
In this combat system, two sides - which are usually the player's side and the enemy's side - attack each other in turns. The side which is not attacking can perform actions to avoid or deflect the enemy's attack.

### **Core Mechanics:**  
- **Turn-based combat** – Players and monsters take turns attacking each other.  
- **Weapons system** – Each player and monster **must** have at least one weapon. (For extra points, students can implement multiple weapons per entity.)  
- **Character classes** – Players can choose from different warrior archetypes, such as **Knight, Assassin, or Wizard**, each with unique abilities.  
- **Monsters classes** – Monsters like **Dragons, Goblins, and Skeletons** which have distinct attack patterns.  
- **Damage system** – Each weapon deals a specific amount of damage, reducing the opponent’s health.  
- **Battle to the death** – The combat continues until one side is completely defeated.  

## Objectives ✏️  
Through this assignment, you will:  
- Learn and apply *inheritance* to structure a game class hierarchy.  
- Understand and implement *interfaces* and *abstract classes*.  
- Use *polymorphism* to handle interactions between game entities.  
- Practice *code reusability* and *modularity* in Java.  
- Develop a *terminal-based game* that showcases OOP concepts.  
- Develop a creative gameplay to make it a playable simple game.

## Tasks 📝

### 1️⃣ Step 1: Fork & Setup 🍴  
1. **Fork** this repository and clone it to your local machine.  
2. Create a new branch named develop and switch to it.    


### 2️⃣ Step 2: Implement the Class Hierarchy 🌲  

- You must implement the class hierarchy as shown in the diagram below:

</div>
<br />

- Class Descriptions:  

  - We have Entity, Object & Location in game
  - Player & Enemy are abstract classes that implement Entity
  - There are 3 classes: Wizard, Knight and Assassin which extend Player (or more if you want)
  - There are 3 classes: Skeleton, Goblin and Dragon which extend Enemy (or more if you want)
  - Consumable, Armor & Weapon are abstract classes that implement Object
  - Flask extends Consumable - you can add more subclasses of Consumable for extra score
  - KnightArmor extends Armor - you can add more subclasses of Armor for extra score
  - Sword extends Weapon - you can add more subclasses of Weapon for extra score

### 3️⃣ Step 3: Implement Player & Monster Methods 🏹  

Each class should have the appropriate attributes and methods.  

 **Basic Actions:**  
- **Attacking**: Players and monsters can attack their opponents.  
- **Defending**: Reduce or block incoming damage. *(Implementing this action grants extra score!)*  
- **Being Killed**: When health reaches zero, the entity is defeated.  
- **Healing**: Players can heal, and some monsters (not all) have the ability to heal.  

 **Unique Abilities:**  
- Each class of players and monsters has its own unique abilities:  

  - **Players' Unique Abilities**
      
    - **Wizard** 🧙‍♂️: Can cast a **special spell** that **heals himself** while also **damaging the enemy**.  
    - **Assassin** 🗡️: Can become **invisible**, making him **immune to enemy attacks** while dealing **increased damage** when attacking in this state.  
    - **Knight** ⚔️: Can perform a **strong kick** that deals **extra damage** but can only be used **after a certain number of rounds** (cannot use it every turn).  

  - **Monsters' Unique Abilities**
    
    - **Goblin** 👹: Has no unique abilities.  
    - **Dragon** 🐉: Can **bypass shields**; damaging players even if they are defending. If there are **multiple players in the game** (extra score scenario), the dragon’s ability **damages all players simultaneously**.  
    - **Skeleton** ☠️: Can **resurrect once** after being defeated, returning to battle with a portion of its health restored.  

<br />

🔹 Make sure each entity **prints messages** when performing actions:  

```bash
Arthur attacked Goblin
```

```bash
Arthur (Knight) attacked Goblin!
Goblin took 15 damage!
Goblin has 35 health remaining.
```



### 4️⃣ Step 4: Implement the Game Loop and Location mechanics 🎮  
Create a simple **turn-based combat system** in a main game loop:  

1. Players choose a character (Assassin, Knight, or Wizard).
2. The player enters the starting location.
3. A random monster (Goblin, Dragon, or Skeleton) is generated.
4. Player can choose to fight the monster or move to another location.
5. In the fight, the player and the monster take turns attacking each other.
6. If the player defeat the monster, they'll be rewarded and they can proceed.
7. Game ends when either the player dies.

<br />
🔹 Example game loop structure:  

```java
while (player.isAlive() && enemy.isAlive()) {
    player.attack(enemy);
    if (enemy.isAlive()) {
        enemy.attack(player);
    }
}
```



### 5️⃣ Step 5: Extra Features & Bonus Tasks ⭐  
Want to **earn extra points**? Try implementing one of these:  

✅ **Defending Mechanic** 🛡️ *(Extra Score!)*  
- Implement a **defending action** that allows players to **block or reduce incoming damage**.  

✅ **Multiple Weapons System** ⚔️ *(Extra Score!)*  
- Players and monsters can **switch between different weapons** during combat instead of being limited to one.  

✅ **Multiple Players Mode** 👥 *(Extra Score!)*  
- Implement a **party-based battle system** where **multiple players** can fight against **monsters together**.  

✅ **Dragon’s Multi-Target Attack** 🐉 *(Extra Score!)*  
- If there are **multiple players in the battle**, the **dragon’s unique ability** should **damage all players simultaneously** instead of just one.  

✅ **(Bonus) Inventory System**  
- Allow players to **pick up and use items** like different classes of shields and more potions.  

✅ **(Bonus) Experience & Leveling System**  
- Players gain XP from battles and level up, increasing their **attack power**.  

✅ **(Bonus) PvP Mode**  
- Implement a **Player vs. Player** combat system.  

By implementing any of these extra features, you can earn additional points to boost your final score! 🚀
